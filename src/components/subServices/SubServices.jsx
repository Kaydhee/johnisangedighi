							<p className='text-sm'>
								mortgage is created where one party known as the mortgagor
								grants an interest in his property to another party known as the
								mortgagee as a security for loan facility. Due to the peculiar
								demands of thistype of valuation, the mortgagee ought not to
								rely on the open market value of the property as the basis for

								the property. We are grounded in the art and science of this
								type of valuation as we advise either party or both as to the
								most judicious figure to adopt having regard to the possibility
